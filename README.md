# hnefatafl-rs

`hnefatafl` is a Rust crate intended to provide functionality for creating
[Tafl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games)-related software. It's an early WIP but the idea is that it will
eventually provide structs and traits that encapsulate game data and logic, hopefully helping to build games, AIs, etc.
