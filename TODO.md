## Immediate priorities

- [X] Implement `Coords` as unbounded row-col pair and use where appropriate.
- [ ] Restrict instantiation of `Tile` to appropriate factory function which checks bounds.
- [ ] Testing for exit fort detection.
- [ ] Clean up unit tests.
- [ ] Remove references to non-standard units for now.
- [ ] Functions for enumerating all pieces and all possible moves for a given piece.
- [ ] Advanced win conditions (enclosures, repetition rule)
- [ ] Ensure everything is documented, including overview of project, which is/is not supported and assumptions.

## Support for extra rules/pieces

- [ ] Implement berserk rule.
- [ ] Implement support for other piece types.

## OpenTafl integration

- [ ] Implement `Ruleset` <-> OpenTafl rule notation.
- [ ] Implement `Board` <-> OpenTafl board notation.
- [ ] Implement server/client using OpenTafl protocol.

## Proof of concept client

- [ ] Implement WASM client.
- [ ] Implement AI for Federation Brandubh.

## Beyond

- [ ] Python interface
